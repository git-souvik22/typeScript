1. Typescript is strongly typed language whereas Javascript is a loosely typed language.

2. Strongly typed languages demand the specification of datatypes and enforce our code to execute without an error because it gives pre-warning before code execution.

3. Loosely typed languages doesn't demand the specification for datatypes which can give you multiple errors and put you in trouble where you have to manually troubleshoot the error.

4. If you want to stop compilation for any syntactical or datatype errors then uncomment the 'noEmitOnError' in tsconfig.json file.

5. As you know "tsc <filename>.ts" command compiles your TS file to JS file so you need to specify the 'rootDir' and 'outDir' correctly like ("rootDir": "src" & "outDir": "/build/js") and also make a new script of "include": "src" so that only the TS files included in src folder which we'll create and make changes will only be compiled.

6. A language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed.

7. TypeScript is statically typed language. This means types are checked at compilation time.

8. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language . This means types are checked at run time.
